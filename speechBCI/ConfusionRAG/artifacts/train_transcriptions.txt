It's much more convenient to have one at home.
We were planting flowers this weekend.
That's a bit of a drive for you there.
Those have been real popular with my family.
Forty dollars every two weeks.
It was quiet and restful.
We still have a lot of privacy.
We just wipe it right away before it dried.
When you work out.
Change things a little bit.
If it costs them something.
I'm going to have to move fast.

That people know about themselves now.
Without charging people.
Four year old Subaru and a two year old Honda.
It's quite a bit different now.
Not as much as I remember growing up.
I couldn't care about any of it.
I just can't do it.
Sitting there wasting away.
Rent a car when you get there and all that.
The further away I get.
We used to do that.
It seems like if you're getting to that level.
The problem is she's a school teacher.
Sewing up the garment itself.
You don't have much spare time either.
I enjoy that too.
As soon as things do get public.
When she came up here.

Out of the state.
I don't know how long you've been here.

To help decide what's the right thing.
Have all this fine Mexican food.
It was good weather.
I'm going to school while I'm working.

When our daughter was looking at colleges.

Kind of a ivory color all over.
Some types of furniture.
Because she makes clothes.
Four hundred hours.
We like the water sports too.
I still go to right back to what I said.

It's American made too which is good.
I just crept over forty years old.
My parents always said if we wanted a car.
If you get pleats.

I grew up in Alabama.
Maybe south.
So I can wander around.
What are you doing with that?
If I had all the money I wanted.
Sleeping bags.
Instead of being completely penned up.
That's not so bad.
In a way it's not.
It shouldn't be that way I don't think.
Voiceover, dialog, spoken text, script, or lyrics.
I have not gone back lately.
What do you think of the spoilers?
They pay so much of it.
Many of the casualties are women and children.
Between the rows and all.
Speaking of noise.
I have no choice but to complete the mission.
What are some of the benefits of visualization?
How do you measure it?
This is the vision that we have.
But there was also a sad little voice in my head.

A lot of restaurants don't take.
Reports on the occasion of the sixth anniversary.
I don't do much with it.

All this kind of stuff.
Now it doesn't bother me at all.
Just like a pig I mean.
Before I retired.

Are you recycling?
That and then I wasn't able to.

He's run into so many problems.
It's was a night out.

It drives me crazy.
I just do it all.
You're alert for the kid who's very drowsy.
Was it a big change in your life?
It's on down the line.
Twenty five in interest charges.
It would be ridiculous.
Nobody could figure it out.
Or a row of seats actually.
You understand what I am saying.
To take care of a problem before it grows big.
There was no word on casualties.
The reality is it's usually not the case.
I'm not sure.
It's actually turning out to be more.
Be our first chance in awhile.
It's too bad it happened.

When you're first married or starting out.
It just depends on what kind they are.
At the craft shop.
How long did that movie run?
Or maybe twenty dolls.
My husband does the same thing.
I haven't had to replace the thing yet.
Not all the time.
That's awful.
You're not old.
I've never been up there.
Some good books that I've read.
There's some different things.
Those are running.

I don't get any of that bull.
If this would be helpful.
An exotic pet shop out in California.
Is it like a foreign exchange type student?
Elected not to do so.
They were great men.
Replace some of the belts.
The great audience.
Plastic and paper.
It took me back to the sixties.
Little things like that.
What I have to do.
You either pay the thing off or they come get it.
Without any warning whatsoever.
Substantial amounts of money.
That's the way they suck you in.
The kids in that class.
I'm a practicing vegetarian.
With the jury actually making the verdict.
My husband is a movie fanatic.
There's still a big question in my mind.

It's more efficient to do things yourself.
What are dialing services?
Is that Portland?
I really like it a lot.
I think we used it for Christmas.

Not total but just from cars.
I'm trying to learn how to cook.
I had a similar thing.

He'll be delighted.
He graduated and went off to college.
He never really got in a game.
It's the glasses.
I hadn't even thought of that.
I wanted him to win best actor on top of it.
We don't get to do it.

I'm not saying that they were.
It's something that interests me.
You have to have the picturesque kitchen.
He's someone different.
There's nothing to do.

I'm allergic to grass.
These kids work really hard.
They had a centennial here awhile back.
Despite all of our open space out here.
Certainly if you wash it any amount of time.
The teacher's in the middle.
Commercial television these days.
I could use a card too.
I don't know if they decided to do.
What do you find that you use yours mostly for?
This particular card.
I was glad to get rid of leaded gasoline.
Want to spend the money for it?
This was a long time ago.
They will kill you.
Essentially anything you find in a house.
There's another aspect of this.
They hold it up to the sun God.
Just because it only takes a few minutes to cook.
Three weeks after.

Do you have to pay for that?
They buy them from you.
At an entirely different bank.
This woman just offered it to me.
I like it here.
He was a courier.
It's hard for me to.

Your body's not going to look as bad.
That's kind of the way I feel.

They were pleading insanity.
It's like a mill.
That would be fine.
It's already done for you.
My voting experience.
Everything had a little bit of curry in it.
They have this World Football League.
I think we are progressing at a snail's pace.
We are as susceptible a society as anybody else.

As far as I'm concerned he could.
They really hit that ball.
I'm looking for something.
I work for a government contractor.
You really want some suspense.
Have a family.
Looks like we're it now.
Do you go by the ads when you look at them?
He's heading off.
Now can she leave?
Haven't been to one for a little while.
I do other things very well.
He had been in that position for years.
Did he go into that in the book?
The recession.
I don't know about your part of the country.
I had someone tell me that.
Do you know where you're going?
It was on his way of going downhill.
You set your brake.
Did you have to do that?
We do it all I really think that.
Our immigration history.
I think in some cases.
